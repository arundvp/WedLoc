## Description

WedLoc is not just another wedding platform; it's a one-of-a-kind social hub designed exclusively for wedding photographers and videographers. Our mission is to provide a seamless space for professionals to organize and showcase wedding media, making it easy for couples and guests to relive their special moments. With added features like media comments and real-time chat, we've eliminated the need for attendees to sign up, making the entire experience hassle-free.

## Usage

Use the link to [Wedloc](https://wedloc-84c89e3ae29d.herokuapp.com/) and signup with your first name, last name, username, email, and password.  The username, email, and passwords need to be unique for verification. Once you sign up you will be immediately taken to your own events page where you can create, view, edit, and delete your events as they fit your business needs.  This application is especially geared towards wedding planners, photographers, and videographers, but it can be used by anyone that wants to encapsulate their special moment in time.

Please note that this version of WedLoc is primarily for grading purposes by the UC Berkeley coding bootcamp staff.
